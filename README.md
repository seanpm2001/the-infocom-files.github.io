This site is intended to collect the latest useable source code of each Infocom game as a starting point for rebuilding using Jesse McGrew's [ZILF](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew/zilf/wiki/Home) toolset. The source code will be imported from Andrew Plotkin's [Obsessively Complete Infocom Catalog](https://eblong.com/infocom/) minus any extraneous files including unused source files. It will then be edited to remove any compilation errors and tidied up to simplify future bug fixes and enhancements.
