This site is intended to collect the latest useable source code of each Infocom game as a starting point for rebuilding using Jesse McGrew's [ZILF](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew/zilf/wiki/Home) toolset. The source code will be imported from Andrew Plotkin's [Obsessively Complete Infocom Catalog](https://eblong.com/infocom/) minus any extraneous files including unused source files. It will then be edited to remove any compilation errors and tidied up to simplify future bug fixes and enhancements.

# The ZILF Toolset

This is under development. Two versions have been used while setting up this repository.

* ZILF/ZAPF 0.8 rel 2017-03-19 (latest release)
* ZILF/ZAPF 0.8 dev 2019-05-01 (local build)

There are two ways of using this toolset depending on whether or not an abbreviations file is needed to reduce the size of the Z-code produced.

## Standard Usage
~~~~
> zilf game.zil
> zapf game.zap
~~~~
## Enhanced Usage for Smaller Code
~~~~
> zilf game.zil
> zapf -ab game.zap > game_freq.xzap
> del game_freq.zap
> zapf game.zap
